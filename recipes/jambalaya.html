    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces. Skin the chorizo and cut it into 5mm slices. Heat the olive oil in your pan and then fry the chicken for 3 minutes over a medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook together with the chicken for another 30 seconds, then transfer both to a plate for now.</li>
                <li>Tip out the oil from the pan and then add the onion, celery and green peppers. Cook them for 8-10 minutes or until they are well softened, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>While the onion, celery and green peppers are cooking skin the tomatoes. Chop them in half initially to let you remove any green stems, and then roughly chop them so they are ready for adding to the pan.</li>
                <li>Stir the crushed garlic, paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme, oregano and bay leaves into the pan contents and cook for 20-30 seconds. Now turn up the heat slightly and add the chopped tomatoes, cooking for 5 minutes or until they are well softened. Make sure to stir regularly during this step.</li>
                <li>Return the chicken and chorizo to the pan, add the rice and then cook it all for ~1 minute while stirring. Now pour the chicken stock in and then season it all with salt and pepper. Bring the contents up to a simmer and cook it for ~10 minutes or until the rice is tender. You might need to add a little more stock if all the sauce is absorbed before you reach that point. Just remember that you want to retain some sauce for the finished dish, it's not a 'dry' recipe.</li>
                <li>Stir in the prawns and spring onions, cooking and stirring for a further 2 minutes to make sure the prawns are hot enough to serve.</li>
                <li>Enjoy eating!</li>
