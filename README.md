# odin-recipes
A basic recipes website designed to help me practice using html.

Completed site will hopefully consist of a main index page linking to separate recipe pages. Only html used so it's going to be fugly!

It's been an interesting experience overall. I can see that I've had to put into practice all the different aspects of the Git Basics and HTML Foundations sections in order to complete the project. The final site isn't actually as ugly as I thought, you can still get quite a pleasing structure with the html alone.

For each recipe page I went with h1 for the title, h2 for the description, and then h3 for the ingredients and steps sections, that felt like a reasonable hierarchy. I included links back to the original recipes in each description since they aren't my own creations, and it also gave an excuse to use the target and rel attributes of the <a> tags. For the git commits I tried to follow the advised 50/72 approach for word wrapping and length. I'm not sure if the main body of the commit messages is yet of the form desired/expected, but I can compare to the other projects once I've published it.

CSS Foundations ahoy!
