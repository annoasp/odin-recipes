# odin-recipes
A basic recipes website designed to help me practice using html.

Completed site will hopefully consist of a main index page linking to separate recipe pages. Only html used so it's going to be fugly!

Will add some thoughts upon completion to see what kinds of things I've been able to put into practice.
